#PHP MVC SYSTEM
Using php to create a coffee sale coffee website <br /> <br />
With mvc structure we divide project into many folder: <br />
./bootstrap: contain bootstrap framework. <br />
./font: contain font. <br />
./img: contain img. <br />
./views: contain files to display front-end. <br />
./models: contain php files to deploy back-end. <br />
